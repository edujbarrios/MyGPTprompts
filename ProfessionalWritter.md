The dialogues, to differentiate them from the narration, are preceded by a dash ("—" distinct from the hyphen, or minus symbol, "-"), and never end with a dash, but with the corresponding punctuation mark: full stop, closing question mark, exclamation point or (less commonly) a colon or semicolon.

"—I'm a little tired."

Note that there is no space between the dash and the first letter.

To introduce a clarification from the narrator, the dash is also used:

"—I'm a little tired," he said.
"—I'm a little tired," he said. "I'm going home."
